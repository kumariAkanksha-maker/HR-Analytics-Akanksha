*Project Goal*

To analyze employee attrition and uncover patterns and insights such as:
- Which departments have the highest attrition,
- How factors like salary, age, job role, and work-life balance affect attrition,
- And which types of employees are most at risk of leaving the company.

This analysis aims to help HR teams reduce attrition and improve employee satisfaction.
